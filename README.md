# goodevening-bot

A Twitter bot that finds the time of sunset and schedules a post to say "Have a good evening".

So far it finds the time of sunset in London using the Sunrise-Sunset API (https://sunrise-sunset.org/api), and then schedules a tweet for the bot to post at that time.

The tweet says the time, the day and then wishes its followers to have a good evening. 

This is not automated yet, and is run locally, but in the future I would like to automate running this code by using Windows Task Scheduler.

I have tried to use Task Scheduler but so far it does not work properly.

If anyone knows how to use Task Scheduler to do this, or any other free ways to host this code, please contact me.
